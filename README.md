Facebook Live Video was a new feature introduced in March 2016 that allows sellers to live-stream directly on Facebook's social networking platform. Since its launch, new reactions have been added to the platform, including 'love', 'wow', 'haha', 'sad', 'angry'. In this project, we will use the data from the Facebook pages of 10 Thai fashion and cosmetics retail sellers from March 2012 to June 2018. The dataset is from UCI Machine learning and collected through Facebook API, containing 12 attributes and 7051 instances. Engagement metrics consist of traditional comments, shares, reactions, and new features. We were curious about customer behavior after the launch of this new feature and whether it changed the distribution of engagement across all types of posts.
